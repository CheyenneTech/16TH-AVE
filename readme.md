This project is a faux webstore where you will be able to (eventually) sign up for a (fake) gardening class and you have access to weather checking and have a count to anticipate Summer upcoming. I included a contact form that will display a "Message Sent" notification, this is mostly for testing purposes and to host the last feature, a word count on the form message field. 



Navigation menu links do work.

My first feature is a word count connected to my contact form. The contact form is not functional yet, you will receive an sent message, however, the contact form is to display the word count at this time. The email being sent will go to my own email. This was set up for testing purposes. The word count tracks the words entered into the "Message" Field of the contact form. 


The second feature on my page is the countdown date to summer. This is located below the hero section.


The third feature is to search for the weather in any defined city. The temp will show as celsius and it will also display the wind speed and humidity as well as a weather icon of the current weather.
